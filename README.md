# <Prework Study Guide Bowtie>

## Description

I built this project to setup a webpage while learning the ins and outs of HTML, CSS and Java. I learned how to debug and how to backtrack to fix code that I accidentally deleted. 


## Installation
N/A
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used to help people and students alike to learn how to build and debug a webpage using Java, HTML, and CSS. If you look youll notice that each section contains these topics. For example, if you click on script.js it will show you prework topics to learn. If we open index.html and right click to "inspect" we can see the JavaScript running in the DevTools console. 
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
